1,"justification","This use case aims to demonstrate the capabilities of the INDICATE platform for the aggregation of ICU datasets for secondary analysis and the development of clinically relevant AI algorithms by establishing an Atlas of anonymized Acute Care cases which we named MIMIC-EU. The atlas incorporates multiparameter physiological signals, laboratory results, ICU procedures, medications, imaging reports, clinical notes, and outcomes including ICU/in-hospital mortality, organ failure, organ support, and length of stay. Development takes an iterative approach, starting with the onboarding of mature and leading data providers (UDUS, CHU-Rennes) and continuously onboarding more data providers thereafter. Key tasks include: (T6.1.1) Establishment of the formal MIMIC-EU workgroup collaborating with the Data Provider Support Office to define a minimal viable dataset and associated common data model and anonymisation requirements; (T6.1.2) Drafting of template data access agreements and terms of use for data providers with the aid of ELSI framework experts; (T6.1.3) Integration of the MIMIC-EU atlas with the centralised metadata catalogue as a predefined selection across the federated infrastructure; (T6.1.4) Creation of fully anonymous synthetic dataset enabling users to validate data requests before execution; (T6.1.5) Implementation of secure workspace supporting user-provided tools or predefined analytical applications; (T6.1.6) Deployment of security protocols and cybersecurity safeguards; (T6.1.7) Clinical demonstrations addressing hemodynamic monitoring, glucose metabolism, regional treatment variations, rare diseases, and geriatric/oncology care trajectories.

2,"justification","This use case aims to demonstrate the development and deployment for clinical evaluation of machine learning models to predict organ failure based on time series data. The focus is on building and testing predictive algorithms using continuous patient monitoring data to identify patients at risk of organ dysfunction before critical deterioration occurs. This work emphasizes the importance of early detection through biomarker-based approaches and the development of precision medicine tools in critical care settings. The use case leverages the federated infrastructure to access multi-center ICU data and develop robust predictive models that can be validated across different hospital settings.

3,"justification","This use case is dedicated to developing a virtual digital twin for critically ill patients, a process that involves numerous sequential decisions made every hour. This approach is particularly suited to reinforcement learning methodologies for determining optimal, individualized treatment selections. A primary focus is optimizing mechanical ventilation parameters for respiratory failure management, utilizing the MIMIC-EU dataset to enhance model generalizability across diverse patient demographics. The initiative integrates supervised machine learning to forecast reintubation necessity and guide clinicians regarding optimal data collection practices for improved predictive performance. Key implementation tasks include: (Task 6.3.1) Accessing contributor data through procedures and frameworks developed by ethics and legal specialists, enabling federated analysis across institutions; (Task 6.3.2) Developing and validating a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes ventilator settings while accounting for sex differences, physiologic differences due to ethnic background, body mass index and comorbidities; (Task 6.3.3) Creating educational materials addressing reinforcement learning development, testing, and validation in federated environments for knowledge platform dissemination. Led by Paul Elbers at Amsterdam UMC."
4,"justification","This use case aims to validate and demonstrate the utilisation of the federated infrastructure for the special case of data access to data of paediatric patients. The use case addresses sepsis prediction in children and newborns while establishing protocols for securely accessing pediatric datasets across federated networks. Machine learning-based prediction algorithms using electronic healthcare record (EHR) data are being developed to predict severe sepsis onset in pediatric populations. The work focuses on building bedside feedback tools to guide clinicians in personalized management of late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS), with particular attention to prevention, early detection, and antibiotic therapy optimization. The use case leverages computational medicine and hypothesis-free omics approaches, utilizing routinely collected EHR data to recognize sepsis in infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit at least 4 hours prior to clinical suspicion. Led by Rob Taal at Erasmus MC."
5,"justification","This use case will demonstrate a use case of data sharing for the continuous improvement of clinical practice. The initiative creates comparative dashboards enabling healthcare institutions to benchmark their performance metrics against peer organizations for quality enhancement. These dashboards provide real-time insights into key quality indicators, allowing ICUs to compare their outcomes, processes, and adherence to best practices with similar institutions across Europe. The use case emphasizes the importance of transparent data sharing for driving clinical excellence and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Through the federated infrastructure, participating centers can contribute their data while maintaining patient privacy and institutional autonomy, receiving in return valuable benchmarking insights that can inform quality improvement initiatives and clinical decision-making processes. Led by Falk von Dincklage at Universitätsmedizin Greifswald."
6,"justification","This use case aims to work towards a national and international European collaborative platform to exchange data and knowledge with the potential to grow towards synoptic real-time sharing of clinical data. The Grand Rounds Workspace establishes a collaborative digital environment for clinicians across Europe to share cases, knowledge, and clinical data in real-time for educational and research purposes. This platform enables interdisciplinary teams to conduct virtual grand rounds, discuss complex cases, and learn from experiences across different institutions and healthcare systems. The workspace facilitates knowledge exchange, promotes best practices, and supports clinical education by providing access to diverse case presentations and expert opinions. By leveraging the INDICATE infrastructure, the platform ensures secure data sharing while maintaining compliance with ethical and legal requirements. The initiative has the potential to transform medical education and collaborative clinical decision-making on a European scale, fostering a community of practice that transcends geographical boundaries.
